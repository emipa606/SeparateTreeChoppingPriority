Update of Landon Martins mod

- Trees should no longer be cut down by pawns with the Tree cutting job disabled. Previously pawns would still cut down trees in growing-zones or when clearing cell for construction. Thank you llunak for the addition!

THIS VERSION NO LONGER MAINTAINED.
I&apos;ve been distracted with other things and Mlie has taken over the mod to keep it up to date. You can find it here:

Separates plant cutting and tree chopping into separate priorities. By default tree cutting takes higher priority.
